# furmods

this repository is for hosting all Furnace tracker modules (.furs) I've released so far, along with audio.

no global license applies to the repo; every module folder here has its own license. it just so happens that most of them share CC BY-NC-SA.

if any of the folders is missing a license or you’re unsure, and to discuss special permissions w.r.t. any specific module/song,
contact me on Discord @ thacuber2a03, or [check my website](https://thacuber2a03.github.io).
